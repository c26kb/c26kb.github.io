<h1>Journal entry 10/10</h1>

<p>So far, Computer Science has been good. Alhough learning the basics of HTML has been a bit confusing at first, I am starting to get the hang of it. We have really learned the importance of divs and indents. I think it is interesting how in HTML, you have to be very precise with each and every piece of code. At times, it can most definitely be overwhelming but I am confident that I will get better. Overall, I am just really eager and excited to further engulf myself into these skills as I understand the true importance of them. CSS is one of the most interesting and important subjects in my opinion. </p>
	


<h1> Journal entry 10/20</h1>


<p> After making various edits and modifications to my website, I am pretty confident in it. I think aesthetically, and organizationally it looks good. I have my sub-pages of Projects, Journal entries, and even About me. In terms of my project, I think it is relatively cool and create. It gives the user alot of flexability and freedom to simply navigate and experiment throughout my project. I also like my animation as it is simple, but effective. I think it is relatively aesthetically pleasing per se. Of course, it is still a little confusing to navigate through my code and pages but with time and practice, this will improve.

<h1>Journal entry 10-26</h1>

<p> My website is most definitely coming along, but I am experiencing some difficulty making it more complex and aesthetic. For instance, I cannot get my journal entries to sync to my website. I am however, confident in my animations and sub-pages. Pushing in particular, is simple but also complex at the same. Overall, I am just struggling to make by website cooler and more complex. I am still searching for ideas in order to fulfilll this. There are however, aspects of my website that I am very proud of. I like the set-up of my "projects" "about me" and "journal." I think it is clear, and easy to see. At the end of the day, clarity is what really matters.

<h1> Journal entry 11-21-22</h1>

<p> This new project called "project 2" is reflective of the complex skills we have learned from java script. In it, we utilized the event listener function to create this effect. We were given the prompt of making our mouse a image of our liking. I chose to transform my mouse into a pizza picture! I absolutely love pizza. It is a big part of my life. So, in this project, when you move your mouse, it is simply a pizza. I am pretty proud of it as I think the code to produce it was pretty complex and difficult. I am however, excited to produce even more complex projects with more efficient code.

<h1>Journal entry 1-3-23</h1>

<p> At this point of the year, I am feeling pretty comfortable and well with my website. I think I am slowly but surely understanding and comprehending the skills we are learning. My website has some projects, journal entries(like such), and an about me section. I am pretty exicted further work on it and display it more. I do however, think I could improve alot in this next semester. I feel like I can be more of an advocate for myself and ask for help more often. I need to sharpen and heighten some of my skills still. This however, will come with more time,focus, and labs.

<h1>Journal entry 3-6-23</h1>

<p> At thus point of the year, heading into the last quarter, I am feeling more confident and comfortable with my skills. Java script however, still confuses me a little bit as I am unfamiliar with alot of the skills. My most impressive project I think, is my valentines day project. I think I expressed my gratitude and love for my mother while also demonstrating my skills. In it, I have a pink letter that contains some loving text. Using the skills we learned, I was able to create a pink heart that moves with your dragged mouse. I think it is pretty cool and interesting. The colors, hearts, text etc creates a nice effect. I hope you book more labs with Molly as the year goes on so I can fully become a better coder.
