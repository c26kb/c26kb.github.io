<h1>Journal entry 10/10</h1>

<p>So far, Computer Science has been good. Alhough learning the basics of HTML has been a bit confusing at first, I am starting to get the hang of it. We have really learned the importance of divs and indents. I think it is interesting how in HTML, you have to be very precise with each and every piece of code. At times, it can most definitely be overwhelming but I am confident that I will get better. Overall, I am just really eager and excited to further engulf myself into these skills as I understand the true importance of them. CSS is one of the most interesting and important subjects in my opinion. </p>
	


<h1> Journal entry 10/20</h1>


<p> After making various edits and modifications to my website, I am pretty confident in it. I think aesthetically, and organizationally it looks good. I have my sub-pages of Projects, Journal entries, and even About me. In terms of my project, I think it is relatively cool and create. It gives the user alot of flexability and freedom to simply navigate and experiment throughout my project. I also like my animation as it is simple, but effective. I think it is relatively aesthetically pleasing per se. Of course, it is still a little confusing to navigate through my code and pages but with time and practice, this will improve.

<h1>Journal entry 10-26</h1>

<p> My website is most definitely coming along, but I am experiencing some difficulty making it more complex and aesthetic. For instance, I cannot get my journal entries to sync to my website. I am however, confident in my animations and sub-pages. Pushing in particular, is simple but also complex at the same. Overall, I am just struggling to make by website cooler and more complex. I am still searching for ideas in order to fulfilll this. There are however, aspects of my website that I am very proud of. I like the set-up of my "projects" "about me" and "journal." I think it is clear, and easy to see. At the end of the day, clarity is what really matters.
